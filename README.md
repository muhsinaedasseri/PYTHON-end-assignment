data preprocessing and graphical representations
data preprocessing: Replaced values in the "height" column with random numbers between 150 and 180 and checked Data Consistency and Integrity.
Analysis tasks: 1. Determined the distribution of employees across each team and calculated the percentage split relative to the total number of employees. 2. Segregated employees based on their positions within the company. 3. Identified  the predominant age group among employees.  4.  Discovered which team and position have the highest salary expenditure. 5. Investigate if there's any correlation between age and salary and represent it visually. GrA graphical representation of all the tasks is plotted.
#####Key insights: The most Represented Team is the New Orleans Pelicans, which is 4.3 %
                   The least-represented team is the Minnesota Timberwolves,  which is 2.19%

                    SG (Shooting Guard) has the highest count (87 employees), meaning this position is the most common in the dataset.
                      C (Center) has the lowest count (50 employees), meaning it is the least represented position.
                      
                     The 20-30 age group dominates with 284 employees, meaning the workforce is primarily young.
                     There are only 64 employees in this group, indicating a sharp decline in representation after 30
                     This suggests that older employees are either not hired or leave before reaching these age ranges. 
                     
                     PGs are the highest-paid position ($373.6M) in total salary.
                     PFs earn $361.3M, making them the second-highest-paid position.
                     Centers earn $283.4M, the lowest of all positions.
                     SGs ($338.2M) and SFs ($326.3M) are well-paid but slightly below PGs, and the PFs  
                     
                    correlation of 0.16 is close to 0, suggesting that age has little influence on salary.
                    A positive value means that salary tends to increase as age increases, but the effect is very weak.
                    This suggests that other factors (like experience, position, or education) likely play a bigger role in determining 
                    salary.
